# 📘 DSA in Java  

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems implemented in **Java**.  
The aim of this repo is to build a **well-structured reference** of problems – starting from basics and moving towards advanced concepts.

## 📂 Folder Structure
DSA-in-Java/
- ├── Arrays/
- ├── Searching/
- ├── Sorting/
- ├── Strings/
- ├── Recursion/
- └── ...
- Each folder contains Java programs related to that topic.  
- File names are self-explanatory (e.g., `BinarySearchRecursive.java`).  

---

## ✅ Topics Covered
- 🔹 **Arrays** → palindrome check, reverse array, merge arrays, largest & smallest element, etc.  
- 🔹 **Searching** → linear search, binary search (iterative & recursive), position of element.  
- 🔹 **Sorting** → bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort.  
- 🔹 **Strings** → palindrome string, anagram check, reverse words, character frequency.  
- 🔹 **Recursion** → factorial, Fibonacci, tower of Hanoi, binary search recursion.  
- 🔹 **Advanced** (coming soon) → dynamic programming, graphs, backtracking, greedy algorithms.
